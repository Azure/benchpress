# - One or more filenames or glob patterns describing local file or files to validate
# - overridden by passing one or more positional arguments
patterns: ['*json']

# - Level of verbose logging. 0 is standard, higher numbers are more verbose
# - overridden by passing --verbose / -v
# - default = 0
verbose: 2

# - Exit with code 0 even if an error was encountered. True means a non-zero exit
#   code is only issued if validation could be completed successfully and one or
#   more files were invalid
# - overridden by passing --ignore-errors
# - default = false
ignoreErrors: true

# - Remove cached HTTP responses older than cacheTtl seconds old.
#   Specifying 0 clears and disables cache completely
# - overridden by passing --cache-ttl
# - default = 600

# - Output format for validation results
# - overridden by passing --format
# - default = text

# - A custom schema catalog.
#   This catalog will be searched ahead of any custom catalogs passed using
#   --catalogs or SchemaStore.org
#   The format of this is subtly different to the format of a catalog
#   passed via --catalogs (which matches the SchemaStore.org format)
