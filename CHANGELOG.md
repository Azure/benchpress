# BenchPress Changelog

BenchPress is a collection of tools and PowerShell helpers to help you build and run tests for your Azure Deployment
code, such as Bicep modules and ARM Templates.

> BenchPress is currently in preview. Breaking changes may occur in minor versions. We will try to minimize them, but
we can't guarantee that they won't happen.

We're planning to release new versions of BenchPress project every month. We will try to include new features and bug
fixes in each release.
